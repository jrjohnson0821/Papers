\subsection*{Ginsburg and Melton Replication}
As a further test of convergent validity, I have replicated the additive measure discussed above from \citet{Melton2014}.  \citet{Melton2014} gathered data from the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP) to code indicators of \textit{de jure} judicial independence using the text of national constitutions.  I replicated their project and applied it to the American states by using the texts of state constitutions gathered from the NBER/Maryland State Constitutions Project (SCP) \citep{Wallisnber}.  Of the many variables avaliable in the CCP, \citet{Melton2014} used five questions to code an additive index of \textit{de jure} judicial independence.  The five questions consisted of: a statement of judicial independence, lifetime terms, selection procedures, removal procedures, removal conditions, and salary insulation.  The exact coding procedures used by CCP are available in Appendix \ref{CCPCode}.
