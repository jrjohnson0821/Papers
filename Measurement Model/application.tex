There is a variety of ways in which this measurement model can be applied in future research.  For use outside of judicial politics, it provides a convenient means to include controls for judicial independence.  This can be applied in a comparative context and combined with \citet{Linzer2014}'s measure to control for both types of judicial independence.  This can also be applied as a control in a variety of policy analyses.  For instance, the diffusion of same sex marriage laws and court rulings.  As noted in Section \ref{Indicators}, if a judge is fearful of electoral retribution, she may be more likely not to rule in favor of same sex marriage.
